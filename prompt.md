# How to write good prompts...

## 1st: The character
This project was mostly designed for Hatsune Miku image generation, but to generate a character:
1. Ask a very powerful AI (ChatGPT/DeepSeek) to describe the character
2. Paste the name in character name, and the description in the description (tab create character)

*Note: Hatsune Miku is already in program, no need to generate it*



## 2nd: The scene
You can create multiple type of environnement:
1. Ask a very powerful AI (ChatGPT/DeepSeek) to describe you the environnement (e.g. describe me _*visually*_ a bathroom) VISUALLY is important
2. Paste the room/environnement name, and the description

## 3rd: Edits
If the character is not generating what you want, you can check the edit character/scene tabs

## 4th: Genering an image

### Dropdowns
Just select the character/scene/type (landscape/portrait)

### Texts

1. Position: give the character position. (Standing up, laying down)
2. Action (sleeping, running)
3. Camera angle (top-view, left-view, front-view)
4. View distance (close-up, afar, full-body)
5. Lightning (Red light, morning light)
6. Mood (Happy, sad, crying)
7. Clothing (Dress, suit, nightgown)
8. Additional Prompt: In this place, you can ask the AI to add something (e.g. You asked a book in the character's hands, and there's no book. You can type here: Very important: the character must have a book in his/her hands)
Click on Generate Image.
If you see Error: You're in the shit if you don't know debugging. So just send me an email, with the error (the error will be in powershell)

## FAQ

### Q: My character don't generate something
A:`Additional Prompt: In this place, you can ask the AI to add something (e.g. You asked a book in the character's hands, and there's no book. You can type here: Very important: the character must have a book in his/her hands)`, if there's still no good results, try to copy/paste additional prompt in other textboxes, this will tell the AI that this is important

### Q: Do I need to create Hatsune Miku as a character?
A: No, Hatsune Miku is already included in the program, so there is no need to create her.

### Q: Can we generate... NSFW pics?
A: Yep, this model is designed for that

### Q: I think that my informations are correct, but it don't generate the correct thing
A: *You will never find the correct image at first time* - You NEED to generate multiple times (Clicking on `Generate Image`)

### Q: Is there example of working prompts?
A: Yep, here [examples/brushing_tooth.md](examples/brushing_tooth.md)
